# Indexed D-ary Heap

# Implementation

```python

```

## Optimizations

## Optimized Complexity

:::Time-Complexity[Time Complexity] 


:::
>Notice that the maximum height for n nodes is $log_kn$
>Building the heap is still O(n) 
>Swim: $O(log_kn)$
>Sink: $O(klog_kn)$
>Swim < Sink

:::Space-Complexity[Space Complexity] 


:::
>O(n)
