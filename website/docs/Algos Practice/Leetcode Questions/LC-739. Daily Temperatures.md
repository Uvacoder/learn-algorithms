# Implementation (monostack/monoqueue)
For each element from last to first we push elements to MQ. Before actually adding an element to the queue, we remove values which are smaller than the current value, this way we can keep a non-increasing sequence. Then we record the distance to the element at the end of the queue and then we finally add a new element.


```python

```
