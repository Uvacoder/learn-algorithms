# Description
Given a positive integer num, return `true` _if_ `num` _is a perfect square or_`false` _otherwise_.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

>For a number > 2, the square root is always less than num/2

# Implementation
## Binary Search
```python
def isPerfectSquare(self, num: int) -> bool:
	if num < 2:
		return True

	i, j = 0, num//2
	while i <= j:
		mid = i + (j-i)//2
		squared = mid**2
		if squared == num:
			return True
		elif squared > num:
			j = mid-1
		else:
			i = mid+1

	return False
```
