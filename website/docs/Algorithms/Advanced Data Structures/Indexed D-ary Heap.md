# Indexed D-ary Heap

# Implementation

```python

```

## Optimizations

## Optimized Complexity

:::Time-Complexity[Time Complexity] 

Notice that the maximum height for n nodes is $log_kn$
Building the heap is still O(n) 
Swim: $O(log_kn)$
Sink: $O(klog_kn)$
Swim < Sink

:::Space-Complexity[Space Complexity] 

O(n)
